1.Alpha Test does not need to turn off ZWrite. If a fragment's alpha less than a threshold, this fragment will be discarded. 
Under this situation, the final result is extreme because it will become transparent or Completely opaque. 
However, this kind of approach is pretty simple.

2.Alpha Blending gets translucent results because such approach can use current fragment's alpha as blending factor and 
this factor will blend with color value which save in color buffer to get new color. However, Alpha Blending has to turn off ZWrite, 
which causes that we should be careful with the order of rendering. But Alpha Blending only turn off ZWrite, which means ZTest is still working.
Consequently, When we use Alpha Blending to render a fragment, it will still compared the fragment's ZVaule and current ZValue in the z-buffer.
If the fragment's ZValue is farther away from camera, the system will not blend it. In this situation, when an opaque object is 
in front of an transparent object, we will render the opaque object firstly and this opaque object will shade the transparent object.
Therefore, in Alpha Blending, z-buffer only can be read but not written.

3.AlphaBlendZWrite uses two passes to render model. The first pass turn on ZWrite, but it can not output color because the pass 
is only used to write the model's ZWrite in the z-buffer. The second pass is used to do alpha blending.
