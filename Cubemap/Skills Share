1.Reflection: In the reflection process, I just need to use the direction of incident light and the direction of surface normal 
to calculate the reflection direction. Then I use reflection direction to sample cube texture.

2.When I get the refraction direction, I can use this value to sample cube texture. However, such process does not conform the 
laws of physics. For transparent object, a more precise approach is calculating the refraction twice. One is that the 
light enters the object, another is light comes out the object. However, the calculation process of coming out is pretty 
difficult, so I just calucuate the light enters the object.
