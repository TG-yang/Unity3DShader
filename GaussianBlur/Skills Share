As we all known, there are many approaches to realize blur, like Mean blur, Median blur. In this project, I use Gaussian Blur to 
realize the blur. And equation(1) is Gaussian Equation. This function perfectly simulated on what level the adjacent pixel 
would affect the current pixel. The closer the distance, the greater the impact. The higher the dimensionality of the equation, 
the greater the degree of ambiguity. 
In this project, I used 5x5 Gaussian kernel to process the image. I will use two passes and in the first pass,
I use a vertical one-dimensional Gaussian kernel to filter the image. In the second pass, I use a horizontal one-dimensional 
Gaussian kernel to filter the image. Then I will get the final image. What is more, I use image scaling to further improve 
performance. By adjusting the number of applications of Gaussian filter to control the degree of blur. 


G(x,y)=1/(2πσ^2 ) ℮^((x^2+y^2)/(2σ^2 ))(1)
